# ArtTimer
A bundle of timers and features for artists.

This was originally a sort of side-project in which I wanted to time myself for my art and keep track of the time, but any online versions would get filled with ads and wouldn't run so well on my Chromebook (it has like 4 GB of RAM lmao).

After being built the first two or three versions, I realized that this was an actual useful thing to have and I should share it with other people, and so, that's why I'm building this and constantly adding new features. I believe that everyone should have an ad free experience when it comes to something simple as a timer or a countdown.

# Some things you should know:
This isn't perfect. I don't expect my code to be refined to the fullest or to be perfect. This is the first ever time I'm touching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in about 5 - 6 years. But, I hope that you enjoy this regardless. And please, don't hesitate to send me things to change or improve, or to even point out a bug or mistake in my code!
